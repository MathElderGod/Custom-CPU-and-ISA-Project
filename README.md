## Assembler

To convert assembly code to machine code using the assembler, make sure you have a file called `assembly.txt` and run 
```
python3 assembler.py
```
This will generate a file called `mach_code.txt` with the machine code as well as comments for the corresponding assembly instruction.


To perform the assembler tests, run 
```
python3 assembler.py -t
```
